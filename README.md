# Citibike Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Citibike usage data from the years 2020 and 2023 to identify trends, patterns, and insights into bike-sharing usage. The analysis is conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook, and the findings are visualized using Tableau.

## Files in the Repository
- **Sample Citibike Tableau Data.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps.
- **2020_citibike_sample.csv**: A sample dataset containing Citibike trip data for 2020.
- **2023_citibike_sample.csv**: A sample dataset containing Citibike trip data for 2023.

## Requirements
To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:
- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Tableau (for visualization)

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Sample Citibike Tableau Data.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells to load the data, clean it, and generate insights.
4. Use the cleaned data in Tableau for visualization.

## Key Insights
- The project compares bike usage patterns between 2020 and 2023.
- It identifies peak usage times, popular stations, and trip durations.
- The impact of external factors such as weather, COVID-19, and urban changes on bike usage is explored.

## Future Work
- Expanding the dataset to include additional years.
- Incorporating demographic and weather data for deeper analysis.
- Automating data processing using scripts.
